# Flanker task (2016)

A set of Matlab and Psychtoolbox files to run a Flanker task with an adaptive response time deadline.

## Motivation

The goal of this experiment is to provide data to examine how well a flanker task with an adaptive deadline actually measures post-error slowing, and what cognitive mechanisms may underly such slowing.

## Installation

A recent versions of Matlab is required (i.e. 2013a or 2015a), along with an installation of a recent version of Psychtoolbox. Then the files can be downloaded using the 'download .zip' button on the right into a folder in the desired directory.

## Running the experiment

Double-click on the 'runexperiment.bat' file. This will automatically run the main experiment script.
